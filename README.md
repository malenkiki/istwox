== ISTWOX

Istwox allows you to deal with ISBN, ISSN, ISRC, ISMN and ISAN code and maybe ISRN and ISTC soon…

Features are basic, but you can check code validity, get some formats…

=== Why this strange name?

This Gem use ISXX codes, where XX is variable, so it is IS2X then I named it Istwox…

=== Do you have some example?

Yes, when I have some times to write them.
